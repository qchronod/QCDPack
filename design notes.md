ModPack design considerations
=============================
+ Do we add Tinkers? Leveling, YoYos, Armor, Mechworks, etc
+ Should there be progression? Or normal quests but allow free play?
+ Are recipes/items/mods locked/disabled based on quests/progression?
+ Can progression be tied to development of certain building tiers of Minecolony (or Millineire if used instead)?
+ How much tech/automation should be added?
+ Focus on more exploration and character advancement.
+ What style/How much magic to add?
